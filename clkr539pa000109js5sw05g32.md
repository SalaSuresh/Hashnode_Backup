Cohesion is a measure of the degree to which the elements of the module are functionally related.

**High Cohesion makes it easier to:**

* Understand what a class or method does
    
* Use descriptive names
    
* Reuse classes or methods
    

**Examples:**  
**Low Cohesion Example:**

`class Utils {`  
  `public static Time getSystemTime(){`  
  `return Time;`  
 `}`  
 `public static String captilizeName(String useName) {`  
  `return userName;`  
 `}`  
 `public static boolean validateEmail(String email) {`  
  `return isValidEmail;`  
 `}`  
`}`

**High Cohesion Example:**

`class EmailUtils {`    
 `public static boolean validateEmail(String email) {`     
  `return isValidEmail;`    
 `}`    
`}`  
`class TimeUtils {`  
  `public static Time getSystemTime(){`  
  `return Time; }`  
`}`  
`class NameUtils {`  
 `public static String captilizeName(String useName) {`  
  `return userName;`  
 `}`  
`}`

**1) Functional Cohesion:** Functional cohesion is when parts of a module are grouped because they all contribute to a single well-defined task of the module. Functional Cohesion is said to exist if the different elements of a module, cooperate to achieve a single function.

**2) Sequential Cohesion:** if the element of a module form the components of the sequence, where the output from one component of the sequence is input to the next.  
*Example:* A function that reads data from a file and processes the data.

**3) Communicational Cohesion:** Tow elements operate on the same input data or contribute towards the same output data.  
*Example:* Module determines customer details like the use of customer account no to find and return customer name and loan balance

**4) Procedural Cohesion:** A module is said to possess procedural cohesion if the set of functions of the module are all part of a procedure (algorithm) in which a certain sequence of steps have to be carried out for achieving an objective  
*Example:* A function that checks file permissions and then opens the file

**5) Temporal Cohesion:** When a module includes functions that are associated by the fact that all the methods must be executed at the same time, the module is said to exhibit temporal cohesion  
*Example:* a function that is called after catching an exception that closes open files, creates an error log, and notifies the user.

**6) Logical Cohesion:** Elements are logically related not functionally  
Logical cohesion is when parts of a module are grouped because they are logically categorized to do the same thing, even if they are different by nature (e.g. grouping all mouse and keyboard input handling routines).  
*Example:* Print Functions: An example of logical cohesion is the case where a set of print functions generating different output reports are arranged into a single module.

`class Calculate {`  
&emsp;`int a, b;`  
&emsp;`void Calculate(int a, int b){`  
&emsp;&emsp;`this.a = a; this.b = b;`  
&emsp;`}`  
&emsp;`void printAddition(){`  
&emsp;&emsp;`print(a+b);`  
&emsp;`}`  
&emsp;`void printSub(){`  
&emsp;&emsp;`print(a-b);`  
&emsp;`}`  
&emsp;`void printMul(){`  
&emsp;&emsp;`print(a*b);`  
&emsp;`}`  
`}`

**7) Coincidental Cohesion:** Coincidental cohesion is when parts of a module are grouped arbitrarily; the only relationship between the parts is that they have been grouped.  
A module is said to have coincidental cohesion if it performs a set of tasks that are associated with each other very loosely, if at all.  
*Example:* Utils class example.
